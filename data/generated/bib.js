        "abstract": "With the growing concern for the health of ageing populations, much research continues to look at the impact of cognitive training, particularly in relation to cognitive decline. We sought to use novel techniques, including augmented reality and portable neurotechnology, to evaluate the impact of a dynamically adjusting cognitive training programme, in comparison to a statically challenging alternative. Before and after an 8-week training period, and at a 5-week follow-up, we used portable functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy to examine mental workload in a mixed battery of cognitive and transfer tasks. A recently developed tablet-based task was used to identify changes in cognitive misbinding. Augmented Reality was used to create a supermarket shopping experience, as a more ecologically valid and realistic transfer task relating to an everyday task relating to in\u0002dependence that quickly becomes difficult with cognitive decline. The analyses showed a decreased mental workload within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and that participants considerably increased their perfor\u0002mance in the trained task. Some results were maintained at the 5-week follow-up assessment. In terms of transfer, we observed reliable group differences immediately after training completion, which were mainly driven by distinct conditions. Some behavioural memory gains were maintained during the follow-up. The use of novel technologies brought new insights into the effects produced by the dynamic computerised cognitive training programme, which has potential future applications in cognitive decline screening and prevention.",

        "abstract": "We explore the crafting of interactive decoration for everyday artefacts. This involves adorning them with decorative patterns that enhance their beauty while triggering digital interactions when scanned with cameras. These are realized using an existing augmented reality technique that embeds computer readable codes into the topological structures of hand-drawn patterns. We describe a research through design process that engaged artisans to craft a portfolio of interactive artefacts, including ceramic bowls, embroidered gift cards, fabric souvenirs, and an acoustic guitar. We annotate this portfolio with reflections on the crafting process, revealing how artisans addressed pattern, materials, form and function, and digital mappings throughout their craft process. Further reflection on our portfolio reveals how they bridged between human and system perceptions of visual patterns and engaged in a deep embedding of digital interactions into physical materials. Our findings demonstrate the potential for interactive decoration, distilling the craft knowledge involved in creating aesthetic and functional decoration, highlight the need for transparent computer vision technologies, and raise wider issues for HCI\u2019s growing engagement with craft.",

Under the title of the Mixed Reality Storytelling (MXRS) project, we combined Internet of Things-inspired approaches and Virtual and Augmented Reality experience technologies, with 3D scanning content creation techniques, to create mobile and adaptable tools suitable for public engagements and industry partners, such as museums and galleries. We present 4 cases of public impact events where the tools were employed over a period of 2 years to create content from visitor contributions, which was then used in follow-on VR and AR engagements. We also demonstrate cases where the tools were used to create content for novel applications of cultural and social informatics.",

        "abstract": "During the operation and maintenance phase of buildings operators need to perform onsite maintenance activities to prevent functional failures of technical equipment. As this phase is the longest and most expensive one respective improvements can significantly reduce the overall life\u0002cycle budget. Based on their previous work, in this paper the authors present an Augmented Reality (AR) based concept and implementation to support mobile and onsite maintenance activities by (1) preparing and generating AR work order instructions based on Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) information, (2) using these to aid the actual onsite maintenance job using hybrid 3D tracking, and (3) creating enhanced and context-related maintenance service reports to be fed back to the PLM system. Preliminary results reveal the potential of the proposed solution, but also leave room for future improvements.",

        "abstract": "As locative media and augmented reality spread into the everyday world so it becomes important to create aesthetic visual markers at scale. We explore a designer-centred approach in which skilled designers handcraft seed designs that are automatically recombined to create many markers as subtle variants of a common theme. First, we extend the d-touch topological approach to creating visual markers that has previously been shown to support creative design with two new techniques: area order codes and visual checksums. We then show how the topological structure of such markers provides the basis for recombining designs to generate many variations. We demonstrate our approach through the creation of beautiful, personalized and interactive wallpaper. We reflect on how technologies must enable designers to balance goals of scalability, aesthetics and reliability in creating beautiful interactive decoration.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a two-phase study to compare alternative techniques for augmenting landscape scenes on geography fieldtrips. The techniques were: a pre-prepared acetate overlay; a custom-designed mobile field guide; a locative media app on a smartphone; a virtual globe on a tablet PC; a head-mounted virtual reality display, and a geo-wand style mobile app. In one field exercise the first five techniques were compared through analysis of interviews and student video diaries, combined with direct observation. This identified a particular challenge of how to direct user attention correctly to relevant information in the field of view. To explore this issue in more detail, a second field exercise deployed \u2018Zapp\u2019, a bespoke geo-wand-style app capable of retrieving information about distant landscape features. This was evaluated using first-person video and spatial logging of in-field interactions. This paper reflects upon the relative merits of these approaches and highlights particular challenges of using technology to mimic a human field guide in pointing out specific aspects of the landscape scene. We also explore the role of students acting as design informants and research co-participants, which can be mutually beneficial in promoting a critical appreciation of the role of technology to support learning about the landscape.",

Over the last several years, AR applications have become portable and widely available on mobile de\u0002vices. AR is becoming visible in our audio-visual media (e.g., news, entertainment, sports) and is beginning to enter other aspects of our lives (e.g., e-commerce, travel, marketing) in tangible and exciting ways. Facilitating ubiquitous learning, AR will give learners instant access to location\u0002specific information compiled and provided by numerous sources (2009). Both the 2010 and 2011 Horizon Reports predict that AR will soon see widespread use on US college campuses.
